Coding Bootcamp HW3 by Kyle Rosenmeyer

**Word Guess Game** is a hangman style word guessing game in which 
the user attempts to guess the word chosen by the computer. The game is photography themed.

This game is useful to learn the principals of javascript *arrays, functions, statements, and 
loops*. It is also useful to begin learning about the power of objects.
